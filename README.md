# Wave Function Explorer

Wave Function Explorer is an interactive, browser‑based tool for visualizing classical and quantum wave phenomena in 3D. It runs entirely client‑side and is available here:

**https://kmackinley.github.io/WaveFunctionExplorer/**

The app uses **Three.js** for real‑time rendering and **KaTeX** for mathematical equations. Each mode includes adjustable parameters, a short explanation, and a live 3D visualization that updates instantly.

## Features

- Real‑time 3D wave and quantum visualizations  
- Multiple modes including:
  - Traveling and standing waves  
  - Interference patterns  
  - Drumhead/Bessel modes  
  - Beats and superposition  
  - Doppler effect  
  - Solitons  
  - Quantum tunneling  
  - Spherical harmonics  
  - Hydrogen orbitals (point cloud)  
- Adjustable parameters for each mode  
- Clean, KaTeX‑rendered equations  
- Smooth camera controls (rotate, pan, zoom)

## How to Use

1. **Open the app**  
   Visit: https://kmackinley.github.io/WaveFunctionExplorer/

2. **Choose a mode**  
   Use the left sidebar to select a wave or quantum system.

3. **Adjust parameters**  
   Sliders let you modify frequency, amplitude, mode numbers, potential height, and more depending on the mode.

4. **Interact with the visualization**  
   - **Left‑drag:** rotate  
   - **Right‑drag:** pan  
   - **Scroll:** zoom  
   - **Play/Pause:** start or stop time evolution  

5. **Read the math**  
   Each mode displays the equation it uses, rendered with KaTeX.

## Purpose

Wave Function Explorer is designed for:

- Students learning wave mechanics  
- Educators demonstrating concepts  
- Anyone who wants to visually explore wave equations  

It provides an intuitive, self‑contained way to see how different wave systems behave.
